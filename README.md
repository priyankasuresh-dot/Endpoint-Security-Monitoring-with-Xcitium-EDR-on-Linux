# Endpoint-Security-Monitoring-with-Xcitium-EDR-on-Linux
This project demonstrates how to deploy Xcitium OpenEDR on a Linux endpoint to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats in real time. OpenEDR provides continuous endpoint telemetry, next-gen antivirus (NGAV), and automated response actions, offering stronger protection than traditional antivirus.
